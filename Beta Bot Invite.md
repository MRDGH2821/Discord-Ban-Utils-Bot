# Beta Bot Invite

BU Beta can only be invited by developer.

Purely kept for Developer's reference not public.

[Invite Link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=906818191060246559&permissions=277562263686&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

If you invite the beta bot in your server, commands will **may** show up. But the developer will not give any guarantee/warranty that the bot will work as intended, since it is in development phase.

To see this bot in action, join my main [server](https://discord.gg/MPtE9zsBs5) and go to [#â–ºdev-chat](https://discord.com/channels/452119784503640084/881108882569711616/) and check the pins.
